# Scheduler MVP

Welcome to the documentation for the Scheduler MVP. This system is designed to manage caregivers, clients, and the complex scheduling logic required to match them effectively.

## Key Concepts

The system is built around a few core concepts:

- **Caregivers & Clients**: The primary entities in the system.
- **Availability & Care Patterns**: Recurring rules that define when a caregiver works and when a client needs care.
- **Exceptions**: Specific overrides to patterns (e.g., vacations, cancellations).
- **The Baker**: A background process that expands patterns into concrete "Billable Items" (Care Requests).
- **The Matchmaker**: An algorithm that assigns caregivers to open requests based on skills, location, and preferences.

## Navigation

- **Guides**: Detailed explanations of the database schema and dashboard.
- **API Reference**: Documentation for the backend services and endpoints.
